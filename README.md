# SPACY
spaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.

#Tokenization
During processing, spaCy first tokenizes the text, i.e. segments it into words, punctuation and so on. This is done by applying rules specific to each language.

#Parts of Speech tagging
After tokenization, spaCy can parse and tag a given Doc. This is where the statistical model comes in, which enables spaCy to make a prediction of which tag or label most likely applies in this context.
